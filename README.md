# My Porfolio: HW 02

This is a single page website where the user can find my most recent works, short bio and a way to contact me.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Portfolio Webpage

The website is responsive to the screen changes for the most part as I was not able to get the text on the main image to flex. I used Bootstarp 5.0

**Navagation Bar** Contains active links to their respective sections, as by clicking work, about and contact the page will take the user to that specific section. Also, the words turn lighter as a feed back to the user when they are hovering over.

**Work section** I do not have that many projects to showcase, so I just put the first webpage that I recently worked on. I used the card component from Bootstrap to make 3 colums. In the first on you find the an image of the website that wroked recently with a short description of the worked that I did and the languages that I worked on. The user can click on the image and it will be redirected to Horiseon webpage.
